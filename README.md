TRAVEL REGISTERATION USING PYTHON AND API DJANGO

Sure, I'd be happy to explain the code line by line:

#from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_exempt
#from rest_framework.parsers import JSONParser
#from django.http.response import JsonResponse

#from Bookingapp.serializers import BookingSerializer

#from Bookingapp.models import Booking
These lines import necessary modules and classes from various Django and DRF components. Let's break it down:

csrf_exempt: This is a decorator used to exempt a view function from the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection. It's commonly used for views that are intended to receive data from external sources.
JSONParser: This is a parser provided by DRF that's used to parse incoming JSON data from HTTP requests.
JsonResponse: This is a Django class that helps in creating HTTP responses with JSON data.
BookingSerializer: This seems to be a custom serializer class defined in the Bookingapp.serializers module. Serializers in DRF are used to convert complex data types (like Django models) to Python datatypes that can be rendered into JSON, XML, etc.
Booking: This is likely a Django model defined in the Bookingapp.models module. Models represent the structure of your database tables and are used to interact with the database.

@csrf_exempt
def bookingApi(request, id=0):
This defines a view function named bookingApi that takes a request object and an optional id parameter with a default value of 0. The @csrf_exempt decorator means that this view is exempted from CSRF protection, allowing external sources to access it without needing to provide CSRF tokens.

if request.method == 'GET':
    booking = Booking.objects.all()
    booking_serializer = BookingSerializer(booking, many=True)
    return JsonResponse(booking_serializer.data, safe=False)
Here, the view checks the HTTP method of the request. If it's a GET request, it retrieves all instances of the Booking model using Booking.objects.all(). Then, it creates a BookingSerializer instance, passing the retrieved instances and many=True to indicate that there are multiple objects to be serialized. Finally, it returns a JSON response containing the serialized data.


elif request.method == 'POST':
    booking_data = JSONParser().parse(request)
    booking_serializer = BookingSerializer(data=booking_data)
    if booking_serializer.is_valid():
        booking_serializer.save()
        return JsonResponse("Added Successfully", safe=False)
    return JsonResponse("Failed to Add", safe=False)
For a POST request, the view parses the incoming JSON data using JSONParser. It then creates a BookingSerializer instance with the parsed data. If the serializer's is_valid() method returns True, meaning the incoming data is valid, it saves the data and returns a success response. If the data is not valid, it returns a failure response.


elif request.method == 'PUT':
    booking_data = JSONParser().parse(request)
    booking = Booking.objects.get(id=id)
    booking_serializer = BookingSerializer(booking, data=booking_data)
    if booking_serializer.is_valid():
        booking_serializer.save()
        return JsonResponse("Updated Successfully", safe=False)
    return JsonResponse("Failed to Update")
For a PUT request, the view again parses the JSON data. It retrieves the Booking instance from the database based on the provided id. Then, it creates a serializer instance using the retrieved instance and the parsed data. If the serializer is valid, it updates the instance and returns a success response. Otherwise, it returns a failure response.


elif request.method == 'DELETE':
    booking = Booking.objects.get(id=id)
    booking.delete()
    return JsonResponse("Deleted Successfully", safe=False)
For a DELETE request, the view retrieves the Booking instance based on the provided id and then deletes it. After deletion, it returns a success response.

Please note that the code assumes that the BookingSerializer and Booking model are correctly defined and imported from their respective modules. The explanation provided here is based on the code you provided and might need adjustments depending on the actual implementation of these components.
